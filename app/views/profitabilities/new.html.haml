        %p.definition Merchant cash advances are a short-term form of alternative business funding most commonly used for things like unexpected expenses, expansion, payroll, marketing, or facility upgrades.
        %p.second The product was originally created as a means to solve the problem small business owners face when they are turned away for working capital loans.
        %p Merchant cash advances are based on what is referred to as a factor rate. A factor rate represents the final cost of funds after fee.
        %p.example For example, if you receive a merchant cash advance in the amount of $10,000 with a factor rate of 1.30, then you will pay back $13,000.
        %p.ways Your merchant cash advance can be paid back in one of two ways:
        %p.way Through a small portion of your future credit card sales will go to pay the money back plus fee.
        %p.way Through a daily debit made to your business or checking account.
        %p.qualify You qualify for a merchant cash advance if you have been in business for at least one year, and earn at least $15,000 per month.
