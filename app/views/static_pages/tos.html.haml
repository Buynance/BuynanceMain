          Company is affiliated
          with third-party entities, including but not limited to credit specialists,
          attorney referral services, insurance brokers, and other advertisers (each
          entity, an "Affiliate"), for the purposes of providing individuals
          with access to services including but not limited to credit repair, debt
          consolidation, and legal and insurance services. Company does not perform any
          of these services itself. Company has not verified the reliability of any
          representations regarding the performance of said services by any Affiliate and
          cannot provide any information regarding the effectiveness thereof. Company is
          solely an intermediary between the parties and no relationship for services
          exists between Company and any Affiliate.

          Upon your acceptance of
          these Terms and any Affiliate's acceptance to provide you with services, an
          agreement shall be created between you and Affiliate for the performance of
          such services. No agreement shall exist between Company and either you or the
          Affiliate except as specifically set forth herein or otherwise expressed in
          writing and signed by authorized Company representatives. Company makes no
          representations or warranties regarding the quality of the work provided by
          Affiliates and urges you to exercise caution and due diligence before
          initiating any financial procedures with an Affiliate or otherwise. All
          services are provided through these Terms at your own risk. Company's
          involvement in the procurement and facilitation of Affiliate services shall not
          be deemed to be the procurement of services on behalf of Company and shall be
          deemed the procurement of services on your behalf. All services provided by the
          Affiliate under this agreement are being provided solely between the Affiliate
          and you. Company shall have no fiduciary responsibility to you regarding the
          services provided by the Affiliate. All fiduciary responsibility owed to you
          shall reside solely with the Affiliate.

          Consumers who have
          been unsuccessful in resolving a dispute directly with a Funder can contact
          Company via the BDRS. Once a Consumer files a BDRS case, Company will (1)
          review the case, (2) run integrity checks on the incident including any
          necessary background or fraud checks, and (3) confirm when necessary that the
          Users have attempted to resolve the dispute among

          If the filing User is in
          good standing and the case meets the requirements of this section, Company will
          review additional transaction information to determine if the BDRS case is
          ready for resolution. For example, we may review the messages sent between the
          Consumer and Funder through Account messaging features. Depending upon the
          nature of the case, resolution may not be proper at that time. For example, if
          the services and/or monies are still in within the transactional process, we
          may ask the Consumer to wait. If the case is ready to be resolved, Company will
          contact the relevant Users about the case. The Users will have up to seven (7)
          calendar days to respond to the case, and there may be circumstances that
          warrant Company's acceleration of the resolution of the case.
