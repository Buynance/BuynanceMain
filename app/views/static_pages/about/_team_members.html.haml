            %span When Yuliya’s parents arrived as immigrants nearly 30 years ago and started a business, they didn’t speak English very well. As a result, Yuliya had to protect them. Her protective nature cultivated as a child drivers her each day towards preventing business owners from being taken advantage of. She brings her 7 years of experience in banking and the lessons she has learned in protecting her family to the Buynance mission of helping business owners get faster, more affordable, small business funding.
