          %span Merchant Cash Advance Brokers Dictate Cost Of Funds

        %p Within the scope of merchant cash advance, a professional services fee is a discretionary fee charged by merchant cash advance brokers. Professional services fees are generally captured on the day a business owner receive funding. Brokers generally collect these junk fees on their own.
 
        %p On a fundamental level, professional services fees are entirely ridiculous as merchant cash advance brokers are paid directly by funding companies for the deal flow they refer.  
 
        %p To really understand how awful professional fees really are , lets examine two of the most common broker compensation structures used in the industry first. There are buy rate commissions and flat rate commissions.

          %span The Buy Rate
 
        %p Buy rates generally start at 1.24 for the leading companies and these companies will generally let brokers sell the money to as high as a 1.38 – I’ve even seen some 1.49’s.  
 
        %p Not sure what this all means? Ok, let’s say a broker receives a pre-approval from a merchant cash advance firm in the amount of $100,000 for your business. If the buy rate is 1.24 it means the money would have come at a final cost of $124,000 if you had received the funds directly from the source. Generally speaking, brokers try to make as much as they can on every deal possible so they will “feel you out” you to see how high they can upsell you during the “getting to know you” part of the process.
 
        %p The more desperate you appear or seem, the more they will charge. When you end up with a 1.38 rate and $138,000 as a final cost of your funds under this scenario, then the broker will have pocketed a cool $14,0000 in commission. But he still wants more.

          %span The Flat Rate
 
        %p Flat rate commissions are awarded in two ways, each method discussed here is deployed at the discretion of the individual firm and their individual Schedule A’s. Funding companies will pay brokers based on either the final cost of funds, or the initial funding amount. Examples; when you receive an offer for $100k with a final cost of funds being $138,000, if the broker is awarded commission based on the initial cost of the funds, then the broker will walk away with anywhere from $7,000 to $14,000 as most firms pay 7 to 14 points on the initial funding amount under this model. Or, if you receive $100,000 with a final cost of $138,000 where the funding company pays on the final cost of funds, the broker will walk away with $8,280 up to $13,800 as firms who pay based on the final cost of funds will pay brokers anywhere from 6 to 10 points.  
 
        %p Generally speaking, under flat rate commissions the commission paid to brokers has been “factored in” as most offers will be in the 1.35 to 1.49 range. Brokers can “down sell” a deal and will lose 1 point in commission commensurate with the rate to which they down sell the deal.

          %span Enough Is Never Enough
 
        %p One would think that a cool $10k in commission would be enough for helping you get the funds you need. However, this is simply not the case. Brokers will come in and layer in professional services fees in amounts of anywhere between 3% and 10% of the loan amount.
  
        %p When I started in the business the leading firms had strict policies in place which prohibited brokers from charging what were referred to as “closing costs” back then.   Today, these junk fees are generally referred to as professional services fees.  
 
        %p Many of the leading firms have caved under the fierce pressure to perform in an increasingly competitive vertical and have relaxed their policies to allow brokers to get away with charging professional services fees. Allowing a broker to charge a professional services fee can be the difference between a firm getting a “sweet heart” deal or not.
 
        %p On a fundamental level the industry has put inordinate amounts of power and control in the hands of brokers because it is increasingly becoming the easiest thing to do. I have had public discussions about the merits of a “broker first” mentality and firms have firmly defended their positions – holding their line, because it is the easy thing to do. Brokers allow the merchant cash advance company to outsource has much as 50% it’s customer acquisition efforts. It’s cheap deals for the funding company and more expensive money for you – the business owner.
 
        %p The lack of willingness on behalf of merchant cash advance companies to market the product more efficiently forces the merchant cash advance company to essentially cut off it’s nose to spit it’s face. They are essentially being forced to allow the inmates to run the asylum.  
 
        %p A broker can refer a $100,000 deal to a funding company, and feasibly walk away with as much as $24,000 from this one deal. They are doing harm to the business owner in the process while leaving the merchant cash advance company in what could be a wayward position. Most merchant cash advance companies do not publish default rates however, it should not take a data scientist to conclude that professional services fees negatively impact default rates industry wide.
