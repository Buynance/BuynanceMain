      %span{style: "font-family: latobold; margin-right: 10px; color: #20acd7;"} RESPECT: 
      %span Most alternative business funding brokerages rely on sales reps to produce business.  However, they have little respect or regard for them.  This is where they are weak.  This is where Buynance is strong.  Most firms will kick you to the curb with absolutely nothing when it’s time for you to branch out on your own (make more money).  You will have worked hard, built a book, only to be subjected to aggressive legal action when it’s time to move on. We’re turning that model on its head.  While you will always be considered family, our goal is to push you from the nest in 9 months.  Every Family member is expected to earn themselves no less than $100k in their first 9 months.  Those who reach this goal will leave with the book of business that generated that $100k in the first place… Without fear of being sued.

      %span Most firms are heavily paper driven.  In order to get an approval and to get a deal done, you have to fight with the business owner for pieces of paper.  Not with Buynance.  Generally speaking, when you get a deal done you have to wait a week or more to be paid.  Not with Buynance.  Buynance pays same day commissions.
